#  0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
## Bubble Sort Algorithm (the simplest sorting algorithm)
it works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order
#### In Bubble Sort algorithm, 

- traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
- In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
- This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is so
##### complexity
- *Time Complexity: O(N2)*
- *Auxiliary Space: O(1)*
