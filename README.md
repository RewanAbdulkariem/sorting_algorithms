## Bubble Sort Algorithm (the simplest sorting algorithm)
it works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order
#### Algorithm, 

- traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
- In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
- This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is so
##### complexity
- *Time Complexity: O(N2)*
- *Auxiliary Space: O(1)*

## Insertion Sort Algorithm
it  is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. 

#### Algorithm  for doubly-linked lists.:

To achieve insertion sort, follow these steps:

- Create an empty sorted (or result) doubly linked list. 
- Traverse the given doubly linked list, and  Insert the current node in a sorted way in the sorted(or result) doubly linked list.
-  Change the head of the given linked list to the head of the sorted (or result) list.
